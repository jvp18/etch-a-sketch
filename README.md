Etch a Sketch Project

In this project, I applied the EvenListener and Event Handler methods. I Initially had too look up Etch a Sketch since I had no idea what this was about before. After grasping the concept, I was able to plan the components out for the project and started coding.

This project has a pretty straightforward UI. I may edit it in the future to make it more presentable. For now, it contains a title, a button and a grid that will pop up once an input is given by the user after clicking the button.

The user can pass a value up to 100 only (as specified in the curicullum). If a user somehow passes a value that's more than a a hundred, it will continue to ask the user for a valid input before creating the grid. Alternatively, if a user passes on a string or symbol that is not a number, it will also continue to ask for an input (hopefully a number).

Once the grid is created, the user can freely hover through each box which will paint it with a random color.

Finally, the user can decide to create a new grid by simply clicking the New Grid button.
